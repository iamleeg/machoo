# MachOO

A little experiment at defining a thing like Smalltalk, ObjC or Ruby 
message passing, but without dependence on language. If you have either 
a thing to generate MIG stubs for your language, or a C FFI for your 
language, you can write objects or code that uses objects in your 
language.

## How do I use it?

You don't, yet, it's not ready.
